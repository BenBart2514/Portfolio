            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>My biggest hobby would have to be video games, mainly computer games, of which I have played almost every type and genre you could think of. If I'm not working, eating or sleeping, you'd probably find me gaming. Other hobbies of mine include acting, coding, modding, board games, watching movies or TV.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>My goals as a web developer are pretty simple, I would love to end up in games design. I've always been a very creative person and I am passionate about programming because it alllows me to wake up every day and be creative! I am also a trained actor and hope that one day I could also be making my own movies.</p>

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>My career so far has composed mostly of sales and customer service roles. I started off in a coffee shop, did some face to face marketing work and then spent a few years as an insurance rep. Needless to say, all of this experience makes me a great communicator and a good team player.</p>
